**Short description**: The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is the official measure of relative deprivation for small areas in England. It includes a range of economic, social and housing indicators to create a relative deprivation score for each small area. The IMD is used to target resources and funding to areas in need, and to monitor the impact of policies.

**Quality**: High

**Risks**: The IMD is a composite score and it may not capture all aspects of deprivation. It requires a transformation to be used in analysis.

**Size and Volume**:

The size and volume of the data depend on the chosen format.
It can be downloaded in various formats, including:
- Shapefiles: These are vector files containing geometric data and attribute tables. File sizes can vary depending on the chosen detail level (national, regional, etc.).
- CSV files: Comma-separated values files are typically smaller than shapefiles but lack the spatial information.
Level of detail:

**A row in the dataset**: 
Represents a Lower-layer Super Output Area (LSOA) in England.
Each LSOA is assigned values for various deprivation indicators across seven domains:
- Income Deprivation
- Employment Deprivation
- Education, Skills and Training Deprivation
- Health Deprivation and Disability
- Crime
- Barriers to Housing and Services
- Living Environment Deprivation

**Access**:
The data is freely available and does not require a password or account creation.

**Potential Usages**:
- Identifying areas of need: This data can be used by policymakers, researchers, and NGOs to identify areas with high levels of deprivation and target resources effectively.
- Understanding social and economic inequalities: Analyzing the data across different geographical regions can reveal patterns of social and economic inequalities.
- Monitoring progress: The data can be used to track changes in deprivation levels over time and assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing deprivation.
